# Today I Learned

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a variety of languages and technologies.

I'm exploring new frameworks and technologies from time to time. And time flies, so very often I don't remember what I already found out when I pick up the framework at a later time.

Therefore, I use this repository to keep notes on my findings.
